    Why we need POM
    To maintain our code easier
    Code reusability

    if we are using page factory
    we need to use
    PageFactory.initElements(driver,LoginPageObjects.class)

    we have initialized it for class once then the driver will find all elements

    if we are not using page factory we will get null pointer exception

    We use some button for 10 different test cases we will call
    that button 20 times
    if that button changes we can modify at one place so that it will have
    impact on all the places
